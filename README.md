# The-Manhattan-Project
Hello friends! As code developers, we often reuse code. Say if I have made an image gallery before, I might just copy the appropriate code from my HTML/CSS/JS (etc) files and modify the class appropriately. This project is made just for that: we share general code structures so that we can add elements to our web pages very easily. Check the README file for more detail.
