# The-Manhattan-Project
Hello friends! As code developers, we often reuse code. I have made an image gallery before, I might just copy the appropriate code from my HTML/CSS/JS (etc) files and modify the class appropriately. This project is made just for that: we share general code structures so that we can add elements to our web pages very easily. 

This project was inspired from Content Managing Systems (CMSs) like WordPress which allow you to easily drag and drop elements (such as layouts, media, etc) with one click of your mouse. I wanted something similar that focused more on code so that we who know code can easily add to our code effortlessly.
